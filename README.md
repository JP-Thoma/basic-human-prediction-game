# basic-human-prediction-game
A basic game between a computer and a player with different levels of difficulty in which both have to choose either a 0 or a 1. 

Who wins each round?
If both, the computer and the player, choose the same number the computer wins. If they choose different numbers the human player wins. The number of rounds can be choosen by the human player at the beginning of the game. 

Levels of difficulty:
There are two levels of difficulty which the human player can choose in the beginning of the game and after restarting a new game. The first level lets the computer choose a 0 or 1 randomnly. The second level has a basic machine learning algorithm implemented which allows the computer to react to the previous moves of the human player.
